# 🌤️ Weather App

A modern weather application built with **Vite**, **React**, **TypeScript**, **Styled Components**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **TanStack Query**.  
It allows you to search for cities, view detailed weather information, switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and maintains a local history of recent searches using `redux-persist`.
